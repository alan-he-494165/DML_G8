# README
This is the space for DML iexplore Group 8 code.

The project utilises ```uv``` to manage virtual python environment. Upon installing ```uv```, the environment shall be set up
1. Setup your own uv venv, named for example as ```venv_name```
```
uv venv venv_name
```
2. Upon activation of your environment (see manual of uv, can be different for UNIX-based system and DOS-based system), run 
```
uv add -r requirements.txt
```
Please do set up virtual environments accordingly to avoid dependency version control problem. Let me know if there is any incompatibility that I am not aware of.

3. Please work within your own branch as a starting point (named accordingly with your initials given in the team allocation sheet) to avoid version confliction. We can merge the code later. Do backup the code actively!
